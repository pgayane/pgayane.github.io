	<a name="Hello" class="anchor" href="#Hello everyone...">
	<span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hello everyone, I am Gayane Petrosyan </h3>

	<p>I am currently in <a href = "https://www.hackerschool.com/">Hacker School</a>, in New York City.
	Hacker School is one of my best experiences as a programmer. 
	Here in Hacker School I met around 60 programmers 
	from around the world with big variety of experience and expertise. This gives you a chance 
	to learn basically anything with the help of other hacker schoolers and of course amazing hacker school facilitators.
	Besides we have complete freedom of choosing what to learn and what projects to do. One can decide to learn a new funky
	programming language, reimplement a regex engine or bittorrent client, give more presentations, pair program, get code reviewed and etc.
	you have got an idea.
	In short: Hacker School helps me to become better programmer and 
	also to become more confident and self-aware of my abilities. 
	</p>

	<h4>February 2014</h4>
	<p>You can congratulate me as I have successfully graduated and now I am a 
	proud holder of master of computer science from McGill University.
	I was part of the <a href="http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~martin/students.html">
	Software Technology Research Group</a>. I worked on discovering API tutorial sections 
	relevant for API elements. The goal of this recommender system is to link existing API learning 
	resources and assist programmers in the API learning process. 
	Our solution leverages NLP techniques as well as structural properties of API tutorials

	I am happy to announce that the CS101 course in Gyumri was a success.
