<h1>Projects</h1>
<a name="hackerschool" class="anchor" href="#hackerschool"></a>
<h3>
	2014 - Hacker School project:
	<a href="https://github.com/pgayane/hasitrp">Haskell arithmetic interpreter</a>
</h3>

<p><b>Tech: Haskell</b><br>
In this project I tokenize, parse and evaluate simple arithmetic expressions in Haskell. 
This project was done in collaboration with <a href="http://f06code.com/">Patrick Redmond</a>.</p>

<h3>
	2014 - Hacker School project:
	<a href="https://github.com/pgayane/tinydino">TinyDino</a>
</h3>

<p><b>Tech: Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL</b><br>
TinyDino is a flask application for shorting links. We first get a word by scraping a website, then get a random dinosaur suffix and make a fake dinosaur name by combining the words. This new dinosaur name serves as a key for shortening the link.
Dinosaur suffixes are taken by processing the dinosaur names on a wikipedia page. We then get a random suffix taking into account the original probability of the suffixes. This project was in collaboration with <a href="http://leahsteinberg.github.io/">Leah Steinberg</a>.</p>

<h3>
	2014 - Hacker School project:
	<a href="https://github.com/pgayane/randomtalk">RandomTalk</a>
</h3>

<p><b>Tech: Python sockets</b><br>
RandomTalk is built as an experiment to learn sockets in python. RandomTalk consists of a server and a client, when connected, start talking with random phrases about weather.
</p>

<h3>
	2014 - Hacker School project:
	<a href="https://github.com/pgayane/soundplay">SoundPlay</a>
</h3>

<p><b>Tech: Python, SciPy, PyAudio</b><br>
I spent some time playing with sound waves. I had an idea of capturing input from microphone modify it in a way that it sounds funny and output back to speakers. I managed to make a real-time version which has quality issues like clicks and non real-time (take a .wav file as an input) which does the job perfectly. Hopefully will make a combined version sometime in future.
</p>

<h3>
	2014 - Hacker School project:
	<a href="https://github.com/pgayane/trendytech">TrendyTech</a>
</h3>

<p><b>Tech: Python, OAuth, D3.js</b><br>
TrendyTech visualizes popularity of languages in github over time. I have done this project to try D3 but meanwhile I have learnt to work with oauth, python requests and of course some javascript.

Visualization is <a href="http://pgayane.com/visualization-demo/">here</a>
</p>

<h3>
	2014 - Hacker School project:
	<a href="https://github.com/pgayane/romugame">RomuGame</a>
</h3>

<p><b>Tech: Python, PyGame</b><br>
This is a very little game created with pygame where the main hero is a cat named Romu. 
In this game Romu jumps over cactuses to get to the end of the game where Minou is waiting for him. 
Demo is <a href = "http://youtu.be/aCUf971y85w">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>2013 - <a href="https://github.com/pgayane/mathnotes">Mathnotes</a></h3>

<p><b>Tech: Python, Flask, SQLalchemy, SQLite</b><br>
Mathnotes is a one of my ongoing projects. Mathnotes is for people in academia who want to save there notes 
which might contain equations. Project was initially started by <a href = "http://pierrelucbacon.com/">Pierre-Luc Bacon</a> 
which I am currently extending and adding features such as adding support for citations.

	2013 - McGill project: Discovering Relevant Tutorial section
</h3>

<p><b>Tech: Java, Stanford CoreNLP, R</b><br>
This project is based on my master thesis research at 
<a href="http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~martin/students.html">STENO group</a>, McGill University.
This work focuses on discovering relevant sections of tutorials for a given API type.
We approach this problem by identifying API types in API tutorial, dividing the tutorial
into small fragments and classifying them based on linguistic and structural features.
The system we developed can ease information discovery for the developers who need
information about a particular API type.
</p>
<p>The <a href = "https://github.com/pgayane/TutorialRecommender">source code</a> can be found at my GitHub account. Hopefully I will refactor the source code
and add more documentation in near future so that it is usable without me.</p>

<h3>2012 - McGill project: Mining Answers to Technical Forum Questions</h3>

<p><b>Tech: Java, OpenNLP, Lucene</b><br>
This was a project done for Recommender Systems for Software Engineering course which led to my master thesis research. 
The project was able to filter "How to" questions and select the most important words and phrases out of the sentence and 
afterwards using Lucene search the index of javadocs to find the potential answer. During this project I learnt a lot about 
using NLP tools and the challenges specific for Software Documentation which help me in my future research.
</p>
<p>To read more about this research feel free to to read the final <a href = "res\cs762_finalpaper.pdf">report</a> </p>


<h3>2012 - McGill project: Smart Video Player</h3>

<p><b>Tech: Java, JMF, JavaCV</b><br>
Smart Video Player was created as a team project for Computer Vision course at McGill University. 
The video player is able to track multiple faces in real-time, distinguish the poses of the faces and 
perform start/pause/stop actions based on pose of the face. For example if person turns head then the 
video would pause and resume if face turns back. If person leaves the seat then video is stopped.</p>
<p> More details, the demo and the source code can be found <a href="http://cs.mcgill.ca/~gpetro6/comp558_project.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>2011 - McGill project: Detecting teams from individual player trajectories</h3>

<p><b>Tech: MatLab, Java</b><br>
This is a course project for Machine Learning and my first project at McGill University. The motivation of the project is that 
in many multiplayer online role-playing games when players engage in secondary communication or form hidden aliases is considered cheating.
This project uses unsupervised machine learning techniques to distinguish actual teams players by looking into the actions the players took.
It uses logs from large scale multiplayer game research framework developed at McGill University (Mammonth).

<h3>2003 - First love with programming: Sharik </h3>
<p>
<b>Tech: Visual Basic, MS Access</b><br>
This is my very first more or less complete program written 10 years ago. Each time you start the game 
it randomly selects a path from start to finish which the user needs to guess. I should say that this is 
extremely boring to play because chances of winning it is 1 in 2^8 (or 2**8 in python).
