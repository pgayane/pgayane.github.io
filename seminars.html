	November 2013 - Discovering Relevant Sections of API Tutorials
</h3>

<p><b><a href="http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/announcements_and_events/seminars/schedule?semester=fall&year=2013&cid=23">Graduate Seminars</a> Series, McGill University</b><br>
Graduate Seminars are short talks by graduate students for graduate student at McGill University. The goal is to present research and to share the experience.
During this seminarI presented the research I have done for my master thesis.
</p>
<p>The presentation of the seminar can be found <a href="res\gradseminar/pdf">here</a></p>

	October 2013 - Computer Science 101
</h3>

<p><b>School N27, Gyumri, Armenia</b><br>
This was a two-week introduction course to computer science which intention was to familiarise high-school students with programming. The idea was to give them a chance
to feel what is programming before they will choose their future profession. Besides that I wanted to show that internet is full of useful information. 
I chose the Stanford's Computer Science 101 online course and translated the first 2 week material into Armenian. It requires no previous background in programming and explains 
concepts through working with pictures. Transforming pictures and applying color effects by writing a few lines of code are truly exciting, not only for students but 
also for a graduate student of Computer Science like me. In the end of the course we also visited a Software Development company so that students can picture the future of being a programmer.
Hopefully in future I will be able to continue and extend this project.
</p>
<p>
You can read more about it <a href="">here</a> and the website with all the materials will be online in near future.

<p><b>Luys Knowledge Fair, Ayb school, Yerevan, Armenia and IT school, Gyumri, Armenia</b><br>
These two-day seminars in Gyumri and Yerevan were part of Luys Develop Armenia Program. The goal was to introduce Natural Language Processing(NLP) 
to Armenian students. It was short introduction answering the questions of what is NLP, why is it hard, what can be done using NLP and a little bit on how it works.

	July 2012 - History of Computers
</h3>

<p><b>Women Employment Centre, Gyumri, Armenia</b><br>
This was a non-that-much-technical talk for mid-age women who struggle to find a job after having kids. 
The talk was mainly a sequence of anecdotes in the History of Computers and Programming, such as why bugs are called bugs 
or allegories describing Computer Science concepts such as a language we create when we were kids as a allegory to encryption.
